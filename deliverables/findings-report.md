# Report Context

The Road Safety and Mobility Observatory (OMSV), a research center under the Ministry of Transport of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, commissioned us to carry out a data analysis project on traffic accidents in this city.

The goal of this project is to generate and provide OMSV with meaningful information about the issue in question, along with relevant recommendations for each case, so that this information can serve as an additional tool to support decision-making regarding measures to reduce accident rates.

To achieve this, a dataset containing data on traffic-related fatalities in Buenos Aires during the 2016-2021 period was provided. These data were processed using various methods, both for preparation and analysis.

As a result of these processes, significant findings or insights were uncovered, such as trends and relevant patterns in key areas. Based on these insights, conclusions and recommendations were derived.

# Summary of Insights Found

### The following insights were found from the analysis:

<br>

**On the Number of Victims**  
* More than 97% of accidents resulted in the death of only one person
* Observation: A clear trend in the number of deaths per accident is evident  
<br/>
  
**On the Types of Vehicles Involved in Traffic Accidents**
* The vehicle type responsible for the most accidents was the car (32.8%), followed by passenger vehicles (24.9%)
* The vehicle type that suffered the most accidents was the motorcycle (44.9%), followed by pedestrians (37.4%)
* Observation: A clear trend is shown regarding the vehicles involved in accidents  
 <br/>

**On the Communes of Buenos Aires**  
* There is a concentration of accidents in the communes in the Central-Southern and Eastern zones of the city, with the Eastern zone being more predominant
* It is confirmed that certain communes account for the majority of accidents.
* Of the 15 communes, five (1, 4, 9, 8, and 7) account for more than half of the accidents: 364
* In 2016, the highest number of accidents occurred in Commune 1: 22
* In 2017 and 2018, Commune 1 also recorded the most accidents: 20 each year  
<br/>

**On the Types of Traffic Routes Where Accidents Occurred**
* In communes 8, 9, 11, and 12, General Paz was the road with the most accidents
* Of all the city’s roads, General Paz had the highest number of accidents: 52 occurrences
* The majority of accidents occurred on avenues: 61%  
<br/>

**On the Accidents Organized by Month of the Year**
* November and December recorded more accidents than the other months, but the differences are not large
* Observation: The month of the year does not seem to be a variable that provides a significant factor to consider, as no clear trends are observed.  
<br/>

**On the Days of the Month When Accidents Occurred**
* In February and August, the most accidents occurred on the 17th
* In October and November, the most accidents occurred on the 25th
* In October and September, the most accidents occurred on the 14th
* In July and December, the most accidents occurred on the 6th
* The day of the month does not seem to be a variable that provides any significant factor. Even when viewed from multiple perspectives with frequency histograms, no clear pattern is shown  
<br/>

**On the Accidents Organized by Day of the Week**
* In April, October, and December, the most accidents occurred on Sundays
* Observation: The day of the week does not seem to be a variable that provides a significant factor to consider. According to the bar chart, there is much similarity in the number of accidents across all days of the week  
<br/>

**On the Year of the Accident**
* Of the recorded years, 2016 had the most accidents with 145, followed by 2017 with 140 occurrences
* Although the number of accidents has been decreasing in recent years, there was a spike in 2018, making it difficult to confirm a clear downward trend in accidents  
* Observation: The year of the accident does not seem to be a variable that provides a significant factor, as no clear trends are observed.  
<br/>

**On the Accidents Organized by Hour of the Day**
* It could be claimed that from 5 to 9 AM there were more accidents, but the accidents that occurred at 8 AM invalidate the trend
* It could be claimed that from 0 to 4 AM there were fewer accidents, but the accidents that occurred at 3 AM invalidate the trend
* Observation: The time of day does not seem to be a variable that shows clear trends

# Conclusions and Recommendations

### Below are some conclusions drawn from the insights found:

1. The result of the univariate analysis demonstrated that more attention should be given to the following variables:
    * Number of Victims
    * Type of Road
    * Commune
    * Victim's Vehicle
    * Offender's Vehicle

2. Given that the vast majority of accidents involved only one victim per occurrence and knowing that the type of vehicle most affected by accidents was the motorcycle (44.9%) followed by pedestrians (37.4%), **it is recommended to implement measures focused on road safety for motorcyclists and pedestrians**.   
**It is also considered a priority to take measures to reduce accidents caused by cars and passenger vehicles**, as they caused 32.8% and 24.9% of accidents, respectively.

3. Since the most accident-prone communes are concentrated in the Central-Southern and Eastern zones of the city, **it is recommended to prioritize attention to these zones, especially to communes 1, 4, 9, 8, and 7**, as these account for more than half of the accidents out of the 16 communes. 
Among these five communes, **it is suggested to give even more importance to Commune 1**, where the highest number of accidents was recorded.

5. Since 61% of accidents occurred on avenues, **it is recommended to give special attention to this type of road when designing road safety measures**.
Regarding the city’s transit routes, **attention should be paid to the General Paz highway**, as it recorded the highest number of accidents: 52.

6. Since November and December recorded more accidents than the rest of the months (although not by a large margin), **it is suggested to pay attention to these months**.
Furthermore, the following dates have recorded certain peaks in accidents, so **it is recommended to check if these days coincide with public holidays, long weekends, or other significant events to analyze**:
    * February 17 and August
    * October 25 and November
    * October 14 and September
    * July 6 and December
